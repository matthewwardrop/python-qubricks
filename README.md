python-qubricks
===============

QuBricks is a toolkit for the analysis and simulation of quantum systems in 
Python. The primary goal of QuBricks is to facilitate insight into quantum 
systems; rather than to be the fastest or most efficient simulator. As such, 
the design of QuBricks is not especially geared toward very large or complicated 
quantum systems. It distinguishes itself from toolkits like QuTip in 
that before simulations, everything can be expressed symbolically; allowing for 
analytic observations and computations. Simulations are nonetheless performed 
numerically, with various optimisations performed to make them more efficient.

If you are interested in using QuBricks, please contact me at: 
mister.wardrop@gmail.com . I will only be too happy to help you.

Also note that use of python-qubricks requires installation of python-parameters
also, which is well documented and stable.
