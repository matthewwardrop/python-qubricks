class Measurement(object):
	'''
	A Measurement instance is an object which encodes the logic required to extract
	information from a QuantumSystem object. It specifies the algorithm
	to be performed to extract the measurement outcome, the type of the measurement
	results, and also provides methods to initialise and add results to storage
	when performing the same measurement iteratively. Measurement is an
	abstract class, and should be subclassed for each new class of measurements.

	While Measurement objects can be used directly, they are typically used in conjunction
	with Measurements and MeasurementWrapper, as documented in those classes.

	Any arguments and/or keyword arguments passed to the Measurement constructor
	are passed to Measurement.init.

	Subclassing Measurement:
		A subclass of Measurement must implement the following methods:
			- init
			- measure
			- result_type
			- result_shape
		A subclass *may* also override the following methods to further
		customise behaviour:
			- is_independent
			- iterate_results_init
			- iterate_results_add
			- iterate_is_complete
			- iterate_continue_mask
		Documentation for these methods is provided below.

	Applying Measurement instances:
		Although not normally used directly, you can use a Measurement instance
		directly on the results of an QuantumSystem integration, for example:

		>>> measurement(data=system.integrate(...))

		Calling a Measurement instance is an alias for the Measurement.measure
		method. If the measurement instance is configured to perform its own integration:

		>>> measurement(times=..., initial=..., ...)

		Note that if the measurement instance needs access to the QuantumSystem
		instance, you can setup the reference using:

		>>> measurement.system = system

			the `iterate_results_init` and `iterate_results_add` methods.

		Implementations of `measure` will typically be provided by integration data
		by a `MeasurementWrapper` instance (which will be a structured numpy array
		as returned by `Integrator.integrate) as the value for the `data` keyword.
		A consistent set of values for `times` and `initial` will also be passed.

	MeasurementIterationResults is class designed to store the results of measurements applied iteratively

class Measurements(object):
	'''
	Measurements is a designed to simplify the Measurement evaluation process
	by acting as a host for multiple named Measurement objects. This object
	is used as the `measure` attribute of `QuantumSystem` objects.

	:param system: A QuantumSystem instance.
	:type system: QuantumSystem

	Constructing a Measurements object:
		If you want to create a Measurements instance separate from the one hosted
		by `QuantumSystem` objects, use the following:

		>>> measurements = Measurements(system)

	Adding and removing Measurement objects:
		To add a Measurement object to a Measurements instance, you simply provide it
		a string name, and use (for example):

		>>> measurements._add("name", NamedMeasurement)

		where `NamedMeasurement` is a subclass of `Measurement`.

		To remove a `Measurement` from `Measurements`, use:

		>>> measurements._remove("name")

		The underscores preceding these methods' names are designed to prevent
		name clashes with potential Measurement names.

		When a `Measurement` instance is added to `Measurements`, its
		internal "system" attribute is updated to point to the `QuantumSystem`
		used by `Measurements`.

	Extracting a Measurement object:
		Once added to the `Measurements` object, a `Measurement` object can be
		accessed using attribute notation, or by calling the `Measurements`
		instance. For example:

		>>> system.measure.name

		Or to bundle multiple measurements up into the same evaluation:

		>>> system.measure("measurement_1", "measurement_2", ...)

		In both cases, the return type is **not** a `Measurement` instance,
		but rather a `MeasurementWrapper` instance, which can be used to
		perform the `Measurement.measure` operations in a simplified
		and consistent manner. See the `MeasurementWrapper` documentation for
		more information.

	Inspecting a Measurements instance:
		To see a list of the names of measurements stored in a `Measurements`
		instance, you can use:

		>>> measurements._names

		To get a reference of the dictionary internally used by `Measurements`
		to store and retrieve hosted `Measurement` objects, use:

		>>> measurements._measurements
